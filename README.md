## Implementation Details

Given more time, I would have enhanced the TreeView component. Specifically, I aimed to implement indentation borders to match the FIGMA design, as well as animations for expanding and collapsing items. These features were beyond the scope of the few hours I had available.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tractician/tractician-mobile.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd tractician-mobile
```

3. Install dependencies:

```sh
flutter pub get
```

4. Launch with VsCode.

## Submission

Thank you for reviewing my submission. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,  
Geraldo Almeida.
